This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and kicked off with [A Complete React Redux Tutorial for Beginners (2019)](https://daveceddia.com/redux-tutorial/).

# React Redux Blog from "Scratch"

This is a work-in-progress project that exists just so that I can teach myself (and hopefully others!) Redux. Along the way I'm leaving notes, comments, and links, so that I can remind myself where I learned certain things along the way.

## To get started:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
